							One day a female crocodile told her husband that she could not eat <br>any kind of food except the lungs of a monkey. <br>The husband replied that he would bring her the desired food. <br><br>

The next morning, he started hunting for a monkey. <br> Finally, he found one on top of a guava tree. <br> The crocodile said, Oh my dear monkey,<br> why are you eating the leaves of the guava tree? <br> There are plenty of delicious fruits near my bathing place.<br><br>

Is that so? asked the monkey.<br><br>

Yes, replied the crocodile, <br>Just go with me, ride on my back and I will take you there.<br><br>

The monkey gratefully agreed, <br>and right away stepped on the back of the crocodile. <br> When they were in the middle of the river the crocodile said,<br> Mr. Monkey, now that I have caught you,<br> I must take your lungs for my beloved wife's food.<br><br>

My lungs!... the monkey exclaimed in mock surprise. <br> I have left them on the guava tree yonder. <br> If you need them let us go back and get them.  <br> The crocodile immediately brought the monkey back to the shore, <br>and upon reaching the land, the monkey hastily climbed up the guava tree and cried out <br>to the crocodile: Oh, foolish crocodile! <br>Have you ever seen an animal leaving his lungs in any place besides his body?  <br>The crocodile was very much disappointed,<br> so he decided to think of another plan of capturing his prey.<br><br>

The next day, the crocodile went to the bathing place of the monkey. <br> When the monkey took a bath the crocodile caught one of his legs. <br> Do not bite my cane, my friend crocodile.  This is the only cane I have. <br> Please let it loose.  <br>The crocodile released the monkey's leg,<br> believing that it was not his leg but his cane. <br> Again the monkey escaped from death and was happy. <br> The crocodile's plan to bring lungs to his wife was a failure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
