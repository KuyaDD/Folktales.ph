							There was once a lizard. She was a friend of the deer. The lizard said, <br>  Friend, take care of my child because I am going to catch fish.<br>  While I am away do not dance because you might step on my child. then she left.<br><br> 

She reached the river and started to fish. When she had been fishing for some time,<br> she felt tired, for she did not catch any. <br>Soon she heard a noise in the house. She returned home immediately<br> because she became worried about her child.<br> She found out later that her child was dead.<br><br>

She said, What caused the death of my child? <br>The deer said, I stepped on it because I danced, for I heard the mangawag bird yelling.<br> The lizard said, Come with me and let us ask from ba.i’ why she yelled.<br> Now they left.<br><br>

When they reached the home of the mangawag, the lizard asked, Why did you yell?<br> The mangawag said, I yelled because I heard the woodpecker drumming the tree.<br> I was surprised why she was tapping the tree.<br><br>

The lizard said, Come and let us go to her. Then they left.<br> When they reached the place, immediately the lizard asked, Ba.i’, why did you tap the tree? <br>The woodpecker said, I tapped the tree because I was surprised that the crocodile was drying up her limbutung under the sun. <br>The lizard said, Come with me and let us go to the crocodile and ask her why she was drying up her limbutung. <br>They started right away.<br><br>

When they reached the crocodile said, Ba.i’, what news do you bring me?<br> The lizard said, We are asking you why you were drying up your limbutung.<br> The crocodile answered, I dried up my limbutung because I was surprised <br>that the shrimp was carrying his gun downstream.<br><br>

Then the lizard said, Come with me and we shall ask the shrimp why he was carrying his gun.<br> They left at once, and went to the shrimp and when they reached there the lizard asked, Ba.i’,<br> why did you carry your gun? The shrimp replied,<br> I carried my gun because I was afraid of the lizard who was running after me.<br><br>

The lizard was surprised too, <br>she did not say any word because she saw the cause of the trouble. She was not able to say anything,<br> so she lost her case.<br><br><br>
