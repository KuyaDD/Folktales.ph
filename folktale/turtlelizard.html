							A turtle and a big lizard went to the field of Gotgotapa to steal ginger. <br> When they got there the turtle told the lizard he must be very still, <br>but when the lizard tasted the ginger, he exclaimed, The ginger of Gotgotapa is very good. <br> Be still, said the turtle, but again the lizard shouted louder than before.<br>  Then the man heard and came out of his house to catch the robbers.<br><br><br><br>  The turtle could not run fast, so he lay very still,<br><br><br> and the man did not see him; but the lizard ran and the man chased him. <br><br> When they were very far, the turtle went into the house. <br> Now, the man had a coconut shell which he used to sit on, and the turtle hid under it.<br><br>

The man could not catch the lizard, <br>so in a while he came back to his house and sat on the shell. <br> By and by, the turtle called Kook. <br> Then the man jumped up and looked all around to find where the noise came from, <br>but he could not find it. <br> The turtle called Kook again and the man tried very hard to find what made the noise. <br> The turtle called a third time more loudly and then the man thought it was his<br> testicles which made the noise, so he took a stone and hit them;<br> then he died and the turtle ran away.<br><br>

When the turtle got a long way,<br> he met the lizard and they saw some honey on the branch of a tree. <br> I run first to get, said the turtle; <br>but the big lizard ran fast and seized the honey; then the bees stung him and he ran back to the turtle.<br>  On the road they saw a bird snare. <br> The turtle said, That is the paliget of my grandfather. <br> Then the lizard ran very fast to get it, <br>but it caught his neck and held him until the man who owned it came and killed him. <br> Then the turtle went away.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>
