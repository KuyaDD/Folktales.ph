							Once upon a time there lived two good friends -- an iguana and a turtle.<br>They always went fishing together.<br>One day the turtle invited the iguana to go catch fish <br>in a certain pond that he knew of.<br>  After they had been there about two hours, the old man who owned the pond came along.<br> The iguana escaped, but the turtle was caught.<br> The old man took the turtle home, tied a string around its neck and fastened it under the house. <br><br><br><br>

Early in the morning the iguana went to look for his friend the turtle.<br>  The iguana wandered everywhere looking for him, and finally he found him under the old man's house, tied to a post.
<br><br><br>

What are you doing here, my friend? said the iguana.<br><br><br>

That old man wants me to marry his daughter, but I do not want to marry her, said the turtle.<br><br><br><br>

Now, the iguana very much wanted a wife, and he was delighted at this chance. <br> So he asked the turtle to be allowed to take his place.  The turtle consented. <br> So the iguana released the turtle, and was tied up in his place.  Then the turtle made off as fast as he could.<br><br><br>

When the old man woke up, he heard someone saying over and over again, I want to marry your daughter. <br> He became angry and went down under the house to see who was talking. <br> There he found the iguana saying, I want to marry your daughter.<br>  The old man picked up a big stick to beat its head, but the iguana cut the string and ran away.<br><br><br>

On his way he came across the turtle again, who was listening to the sound produced <br> by the rubbing of two bamboos when the wind blew. <br> What! Are you here again? said the iguana.<br><br><br>

Be quiet! said the turtle. <br> I am listening to the pipe of my grandfather up there.  Don't you hear it?<br><br><br>

The iguana wanted to see the turtle's grandfather, so he climbed up the tree, <br>and put his mouth between the two bamboos that were rubbing together. <br> His mouth was badly pinched, and he fell down to the ground. <br> The turtle meanwhile had disappeared.<br><br><br>
- THE END -	
<br><br><br><br>

MORAL LESSON: This teaches that one who believes foolishly will be injured.
