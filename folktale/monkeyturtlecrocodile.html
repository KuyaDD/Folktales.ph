							<br> 
							There was once a monkey who used to deceive everybody whom he met.<br>  As is the case with most deceivers, he had many enemies who tried to kill him.<br> <br> 

One day, while he was walking in the streets of his native town, <br> he met in a by-lane a turtle and a crocodile. <br>  They were so tired that they could hardly breathe. <br>  I'll try to deceive these slow creatures of the earth, said the monkey to himself.<br>   So said, so done.  He approached the crocodile and turtle, and said to them, <br> My dear sirs, you are so tired that you can hardly move!  <br> Where did you come from?<br> <br> 

The two travellers were so much affected by the kind words of the monkey, <br> that they told him all about themselves with the greatest candor imaginable. <br>  They said, We are strangers who have just made<br>  a long journey from our native town. <br>  We don't know where to get food or where to spend this cold night.<br> <br> 

I'll conduct you to a place where you can<br>  spend the night and get all you want to eat, said the monkey.<br> <br> 

All right, said the two travellers.<br>   Lead on!  For we are very hungry and at the same time very tired.<br> <br> 

Follow me, said the crafty monkey.<br> <br> 

The turtle and the crocodile followed the monkey,<br>  and soon he brought them to a field full of ripe pumpkins. <br>  Eat all the pumpkins you want, and then rest here. <br>  Meanwhile I'll go home and take my sleep, too.<br> <br> 

While the two hungry travellers were enjoying a hearty meal, <br> the owner of the plantation happened to pass by.<br>   When he saw the crocodile, he called to his laborers, <br> and told them to bring long poles and their bolos.  <br> The turtle clung to the tail of the crocodile, and away they went.<br> <br> 

Don't cling to my tail! Don't cling to my tail! said the crocodile. <br>  I cannot run fast if you cling to my tail. <br>  Let go!  For the men will soon overtake us.<br> <br> 

I have to cling to your tail, said the turtle,<br>  or else there will be no one to push you.<br> <br> 

But their attempt to escape was unsuccessful. <br>  The men overtook them and killed them both. <br>  Such was the unhappy end of the turtle and the crocodile.<br> <br> <br> <br> 

- THE END -		<br> <br> <br> <br> 

MORAL: Never trust a new friend or an old enemy.
